# HonorsOption4

### Reflective Essay

So, this final honors option of mine put me to work in the Unity engine, my goal was to create a Unity project that combines some if not all of the aspects I learned in my Game Programming studio class. As a learner, I'd say that it really showed me that combining elements that you've learned separately and putting them together can present a whole new kind of challenge compared to the ones faced when first learning those aspects. Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to include all of the aspects I learned from the class in this project, not to mention there were some that probably wouldn't have even fit in anyway, like the networking code project for example. But even the ones I did include, like PlayerPrefs, still required me to think for myself a little bit rather than just use notes from previous projects, this project was a bit more independent than the ones that were part of the class after all. For future reference, I hope to also think a little beyond the notes when it comes to putting projects together, especially since I may or may not end up going into independent game design after graduating. For anyone in the future doing a contract like this, my advice to them is to make sure they absolutely know the ropes of a certain aspect before implementing it into the project, as that will help you to give more thinking room to independent thought, allowing you to put your own twist on the project.
